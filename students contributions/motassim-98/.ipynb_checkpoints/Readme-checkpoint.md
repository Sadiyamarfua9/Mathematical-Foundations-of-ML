Clean the dataset.

Find input and output features.

The input features can be gender, test prepration course, math score, reading score and writing score. 
The output feature can be a new feature grouping the students into " Advanced learners, Average and slow learners " using a classification model.
For a prediction model, the output feature  can be the predicted GPA of these students based on their input scores or a predicted measure of their future performance.
