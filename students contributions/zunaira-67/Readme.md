Find the algorithm which can be applied on this dataset?
For the given customer dataset, a regression model can be applied to predict the Spending Score based on input features such as CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income ($), Profession, Work Experience, and Family Size. Since the output feature Spending Score is a continuous value, regression is a suitable method. "Multi-Linear Regression" or "Random Forest" can be used for prediction.

We can also apply clustering algorithm such as "K-Means Clustering" to group the customers based on features like age, profession, annual income and spending score.
